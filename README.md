# DisplayIn
DisplayIn is a powerful tool that allows you to stream any device to your PC using a capture device.
It's simple and easy to use. You can turn any laptop into an extra monitor, record and capture screenshots
from your favorite console, or even view your PC's BIOS screen.

***Beta version notice*** - This application is currently in beta testing. Please report any bugs you encounter.
